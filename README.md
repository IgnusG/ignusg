### Hi there üëã

![GitHub Stats!](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ignusg&show_icons=true&icon_color=0366d6&bg_color=ffffff&hide_title=true)

The name's IgnusG - yes that's my real name<!-- No it isn't ^^' -->.

I'm currently working at a startup based in Germany, while I finish my university degree.  
I love Open Source Projects ‚ù§, which is why I try and do my best at contributing back wherever I can.

My focus is mostly on frontend (React, Preact, Svelte, Vanilla...). I'm a fan of types (Typescript!) and clean testable code (jest, cypress).  
I have **some** experience with backend and OPS too (RoR, Kubernetes, Gcloud...).  
My theoretical background is in Network Security and Software Engineering.

I also have a blog<!-- WIP üôè -->, so if you're interested in the story behind some of my projects, my learnings or ramblings feel free to [check it out](https://ignusg.github.io/) (https://ignusg.github.io/).

Thank you for your time! <!-- If you've made it this far, here is a cookie for you üç™ -->
