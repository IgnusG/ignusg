I'm JJ (aka IgnusG).

I focus for the most part on <strong>frontend</strong>, primarily on React but I have experience with other frameworks like Svelte or Vue too. I favour strongly typed languages (Typescript ‚ù§) and clean testable code. I also have some limited experience in <strong>backend development</strong> with Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, Golang and Rust among others.

I ‚ù§ Open Source and its community.

Here are some of my latest interests I'm exploring:
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) & home automation in general ([pyscript](https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/tree/master))
- Google Cloud AI and Machine Learning ([langchain](https://www.langchain.com/))
- [Remix](https://remix.run/) ([vite](https://vitejs.dev/) & [vitest](https://vitest.dev/))
