I'm JJ (aka IgnusG). <!-- Hello there sneaky source code viewer, enjoy the stay ;) --> 

I ❤ Open Source and its community, and I try to do my best at contributing back wherever I can. I pretty much owe half of what I know to experimenting and learning from OSS.

I focus mostly on <strong>frontend</strong> (like React, Svelte, Vanilla, Vue...). I favour strongly typed languages (such as Typescript<!-- Why are there so many libraries without types?! :( -->) and <strong>clean testable code</strong> (jest, cypress, ava, testing-library to name a few libraries I've worked with). 
  
I have some experience in <strong>backend development</strong> (RoR, NodeJS, Golang, Rust) and <strong>cloud architecture and maintenance</strong> (Kubernetes, Gcloud <!-- And Azure, but since my last login attempt I'm still waiting for my OTP Email. 2 years and counting... -->). My theoretical background from the Uni is in Security and Software Engineering. 
  
Thanks for the visit fellow coder 😉 <!-- If you've made it this far, here is a cookie for you 🍪 -->
