I'm Jonathan (aka IgnusG). <!-- Hello there sneaky source code viewer, enjoy the stay ;) --> 
  
I have just finished my M.Sc. in Computer Science and I'm looking for my next challenge to tackle.

I ❤ Open Source and its community, and I try to do my best at contributing back wherever I can. I pretty much owe half of what I know to experimenting and learning from OSS.

I focus mostly on <strong>frontend</strong> (like React, Svelte, Vanilla, Vue...). I favour strongly typed languages (such as Typescript<!-- Why are there so many libraries without types?! :( -->) and <strong>clean testable code</strong> (jest, cypress, ava, testing-library to name a few libraries I've worked with). 
  
I also have experience in <strong>backend development</strong> (RoR, NodeJS, Golang, Rust) and <strong>cloud architecture and maintenance</strong> (Kubernetes, Gcloud <!-- And Azure, but since my last login attempt I'm still waiting for my OTP Email. 2 years and counting... -->). My theoretical background from the University is in Security and Software Engineering. 

Some other languages that I use on a case-by-case basis are Python and Java. I'm hoping to tackle mobile app development (specifically React Native) in the near future.
