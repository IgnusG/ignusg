The name's Jonathan (aka IgnusG). Nice to meet you! <!-- Hello there sneaky source code viewer, enjoy the stay ;) -->

I'm currently working at a startup based in Germany, while I finish my university degree.  
I ‚ù§ Open Source Projects, which is why I try and do my best at contributing back wherever I can.

My focus is mostly on frontend (React, Preact, Svelte, Vanilla...). I'm a fan of types (Typescript!<!-- Why are there so many libraries without types?! :( -->) and clean testable code (jest, cypress).  
I have **some** experience with backend and OPS too (RoR, Kubernetes, Gcloud...<!-- And Azure, but since my last login attempt I'm still waiting for my OTP Email. 2 years and counting... -->).  
My theoretical background is in Network Security and Software Engineering.

You can have a look below to see what I'm currently reading the most about.
